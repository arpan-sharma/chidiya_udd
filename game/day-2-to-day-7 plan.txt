Day 2: Setting Up Basic Game Logic and Frontend Integration
Tasks for Day 2:

    Frontend Game Interface Design:
        Design the main game screen in React.
        Create basic UI components (buttons for "Udd" and "Not Udd", score display, timer).

    Implement Entity Generation Logic:
        Write JavaScript function to generate random entities (bird, ant, etc.) in React.
        Display these entities on the screen at regular intervals.

    Setup WebSocket Connection:
        Integrate WebSocket connection from React frontend to Django backend.
        Test sending and receiving messages between frontend and backend.

    Handle User Input:
        Capture user input (button clicks) in React.
        Send user responses to Django backend via WebSocket.

Day 3: Implementing Backend Game Logic and Score Tracking
Tasks for Day 3:

    Backend Game Logic:
        Implement logic in Django consumer to handle user responses.
        Validate if the response is correct based on the entity (bird/ant).

    Score Management:
        Update user scores based on their responses.
        Send updated scores back to the frontend via WebSocket.

    Database Setup for Scores:
        Create a database model to store user scores.
        Update Django views and models to handle score data.

Day 4: Advanced Game Features and Improvements
Tasks for Day 4:

    Timer and Speed Increase:
        Implement game timer in frontend.
        Increase the speed of entity display every 15 seconds.

    Game Over Logic:
        Define conditions for game over (time out or maximum score).
        Implement game over screen in React.

    Enhance UI/UX:
        Add animations and sounds for better user experience.
        Improve overall UI design for the game.

Day 5: Multiplayer Mode Implementation
Tasks for Day 5:

    Multiplayer Lobby Setup:
        Create a lobby system in React for players to join multiplayer games.
        Handle multiple WebSocket connections in Django.

    Real-Time Communication:
        Synchronize game state between multiple players using WebSockets.
        Implement logic to handle multiple playersâ€™ inputs.

    Scoreboard for Multiplayer:
        Display real-time scoreboard showing scores of all players.
        Handle scoring updates and display them in real-time.

Day 6: Testing and Debugging
Tasks for Day 6:

    Unit Testing:
        Write unit tests for Django backend logic.
        Test WebSocket connections and game logic.

    Integration Testing:
        Test the integration between React frontend and Django backend.
        Ensure real-time updates and score tracking are working correctly.

    Bug Fixes:
        Identify and fix bugs in the application.
        Optimize performance and improve code quality.

Day 7: Deployment and Final Touches
Tasks for Day 7:

    Prepare for Deployment:
        Set up a production environment for Django and React.
        Configure a web server (e.g., Nginx) to serve the application.

    Deploy Application:
        Deploy the Django backend on a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
        Deploy the React frontend on a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).

    Final Touches:
        Perform final testing in the production environment.
        Add any final touches or improvements based on feedback.
